This is some simple html for a Notion Potion widget.

I use Notion to track my dog's training, care, and vet information, and wanted to add a widget that shows his current age on the homepage.

However, I was indecisive and created two separate files. One shows his age in weeks and days, and the other shows his age in months, weeks, and days.

This is the link that has details on how to create a new widget: https://www.potions.dev/Create-a-widget-in-5-minutes-865211938cfb4ef2aad53d67da476736
