This is some simple html for a Notion Potion widget.

I use Notion to track my dog's training, care, and vet information, and wanted to add a widget that shows his current age to the homepage.

However, I'm indecisive. Because of that, I created two separate files, one of which shows his age in weeks and days, and the other of which shows his age in months, weeks, and days.

This is the link that has details on how to create a new widget: https://www.potions.dev/Create-a-widget-in-5-minutes-865211938cfb4ef2aad53d67da476736
